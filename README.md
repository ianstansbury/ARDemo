# ARDemo

Demo school project for android augmented reality. This was my final project for the class. Basic concept is a listview of buildings around the school campus. When a location was selected the camera was turned on with an openGL layover. The overlay showed the location of the building using gps coordinates that show you where to go. Used an older version a ARDroid project.
